# radiation-dose-tracker# Radiation Dose Tracker

This is my first Python side project, designed to help visualize and analyze patient radiotherapy dose data.

## Purpose

In radiotherapy, monitoring and analyzing daily dose delivery is critical. This tool helps automate that process using basic Python and data visualization libraries.

## Features

- Read CSV files with patient dose records
- Calculate mean, max, and standard deviation of daily doses
- Generate time-series plots using matplotlib

## Example Data Format
